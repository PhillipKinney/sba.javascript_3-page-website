### Description
* I decided to design a 3 page website the allows a user to see the top 5 restartants, submit thier favorite restaurants, and search for the weekly deals at one of the top 5 restaurants in Raleigh or Durham, NC.

## Technologies Used
*HTML
*CSS
*Bootstrap
*Java Script

## Design Process
* I started by building a skeleton of the website using html and bootstrap elements. I then added in photos, tables, and made adjustments in CSS to bring the appearance more closely in line with what I wanted.

* Once that was completed I added in the JavaScript element. I used JavaScript to add a search feature (see citation below) to my Raleigh and Durham pages that allows users to search for the weekly specials at the top 5 restaurants in each respective city.

## Challenges
* I ran into an issue with one of the links on my homepage not working. I did some research on StackOverflow and learned that the issue could be due a <Div> covering the link up. I checked my <Div>'s, and realized that this was the issue so I made the necessary adjustment.
* Implementing and troubleshooting the JavaScript ended up being pretty time consuming. I had trouble deciding what to feature to add. The search feature I decided to add worked initially, but stopped working after I made some adjustments to the code. I reverted elements that could have caused the error, but still could not get it back working properly. On the upside, I feel like I gained a much better understanding of the eventhandler and how it interacts with HTML through this process.

# Citation
* Idea for the search feature came from the Mozilla Developer site. I adjusted the HTML and JavaSpript code where needed to fit my project.
